    <h4>The cruelty of crypto</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The following year’s Crypto.com Super Bowl offering featured the basketball star LeBron James. An older LeBron has travelled back to 2003, to his messy high-school bedroom and his 18-year-old self. ‘All right, so… cordless headphones?’ says the young LeBron, dressed in his Fighting Irish jersey. ‘You can watch movies through your phone? And y’all got electric cars?’ The teenage LeBron pronounces: ‘The future is crunk.’ He’s pacing the room, palming his basketball, brimming with what the agency pitch might have called ‘youthful optimism’. ‘Anything else you want to know?’ his older self asks, looking on like a sage. Young LeBron replies: ‘Is the hype too much?’ He then flops down beside himself on the edge of the single bed. The camera pans to a newspaper cutting taped to the wall, a sports page with the bold headline ‘Is LeBron James Going Straight To The League?’ He’s suddenly serious: ‘Am I ready?’ His older self replies: ‘I can’t tell you everything but, if you want to make history, you got to call your own shots.’ There’s a pause. The camera pivots above as the two LeBrons begin to chant: ‘We going to the league!’ It’s close to ‘We’re all gonna make it!’ – the battle cry of optimistic crypto investors everywhere before the FTX crash.
